    overview: I've been responsible for the continuous development and maintenance of Web Applications. My focus has been on Python (Flask) for back-end work, but Iâ€™ve also handled full-stack tasks like front-end development (Angular), database design, and application deployment.<br/> Working within a security company has taught me a lot about security best-practices, and the importance of following security standards like the OWASP guidelines.
